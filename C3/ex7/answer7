navigator.plugins

In general, a web site cannot tell what addons you have.

There are two ways that a web site can tell things about a web browser.

    HTTP headers, such as User-Agent and Cookie, that the browser sends with the request.
    Javascript code that the browser runs.

The HTTP headers do not include information about your addons.


Javascript code that runs in your browser may detect the presence of some add-ons,
if the Javascript specifically checks for something that indicates the presence of a particular add-on.
