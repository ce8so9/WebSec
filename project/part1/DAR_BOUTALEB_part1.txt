IDF Eventer can be accessed at the following URL:

http://kingofidols.net:8080/app/home

Prior registration is needed to access it. If you register for the first time, automatic login ensues.

* How to trigger an XSS vulnerability on IDF Eventer

- Go to the event registration page (Créer nouveau évènement)
- insert <script>alert("evil code")</script> into any text field that is not a Datepicker field
- the code will be executed on the user home page or when visiting the event page

Why is that attack possible?
- There is no input sanitation and validation performed on either side (client and server).
Thus, all code is inserted verbatim into the database and retrieved when needed.


* How to trigger a CSRF vulnerability on IDF Eventer

It is not exacty a CSRF vuln per say, as form content is submitted via AJAX to the REST API.

- Go to the event registration page
- Craft a script/img tag with payload js file (see test.js), and put it in a textfield using the xss vulnerability
- when the page is loaded by the victim, it will create unbeknown to the victim an event to his name where he would offer free food and drinks

In both cases, the url cannot be too large due to constraints on the field size of the data in the database:
  `title` VARCHAR( 60 ) NOT NULL,
  `descr` VARCHAR( 140 ) NOT NULL,
  `event_type` VARCHAR( 15 ) NOT NULL,
  `address` VARCHAR( 80 ) NOT NULL,

Whole scripts cannot be inserted successfully in the textfields, so they must be put in javascript files and uploaded to a server.

Why is that attack possible?

- It leverages the XSS vulnerability mentioned above.
- The REST API is unprotected, and does not require authentication.
